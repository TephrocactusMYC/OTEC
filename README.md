# OTEC
An encryption container implementation on OP-TEE. Due to practical considerations, it is not open-sourced at the moment. However, you can get a general understanding of my work through the following [patent](./2025103020170.pdf) (Chinese version). [This work](https://github.com/TephrocactusMYC/TREO) and the work in this repository are two different outputs from the same research phase.
